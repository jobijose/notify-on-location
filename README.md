Notify On Location (NOL)

NOL is an android app which notifies the recipient of the updated location of the rider. The idea of this app is to notify( i.e., by sending text message) the recipient when the rider (who is using this app) is at the nearest location. 
The layout of the app displays 
1. Map View: Current location of the rider
2. Location picker: The rider/user needs to select the location of the recipient.
3. Contact picker: The rider/user needs to select the contact number of the recipient to whom the message will be sent when the rider reaches the nearest location
4. Start button: To start the event
5. Stop button: To stop the event

The app when started checks the distance between the current location and destination when the location of the rider reaches nearer to the recipient by 1000 meters then notification(in the form of text message) is triggered to the recipient.

NOTE: SMS charges apply based on the network operator.
      You need to provide Google map api key.
      Developed and tested in Android 8.0(Oreo) - API Level: 26
